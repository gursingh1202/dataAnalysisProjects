At the same time, rate cuts would push investors away from investments tied to interest rates and towards shares, in a further boost to prices.\nTech companies have also been lifted by hopes that advances in artificial intelligence will unleash new growth.\nThe improvement in sentiment is also trickling out to the public, who have seen retirement and investment accounts recover, while gas prices come down and price increases in other items ease.\nThe University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumers, a closely tracked barometer of mood, on Friday reported that sentiment this month had risen to the highest level since 2021, up more than 21% from a year ago.\n\"Consumer views were supported by confidence that inflation has turned a corner and strengthening income expectations,\" the survey said.\n\"Over the last two months, sentiment has climbed a cumulative 29%, the largest two-month increase since 1991 as a recession ended.\"\nRelated Topics\nNASDAQ\nUS economy\nS&P 500\nDow Jones Industrial Average\nMore on this story\nUS inflation picks up more than expected\nPublished\n11 January\nUS home sales see worst year since 1995\nPublished\n19 January\nGlobal economy set for weakest growth since Covid\nPublished\n9 January",

        "article": "Coronavirus: FTSE 100, Dow, S&P 500 in worst day since 1987\nPublished\n12 March 2020\nShare\nclose panel\nShare page\nCopy link\nAbout sharing\nImage source, Reuters\nShares around the world have plunged as investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth with government action insufficient to arrest the decline.\nThe main UK index dropped more than 10% in its worst day since 1987.\nIn the US, the Dow and S&P 500 were also hit by their steepest daily falls since 1987.\nThe declines came despite actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to ease financial strains.\nAt the start of US trading, plummeting shares triggered an unusual automatic suspension in trading for the second time this week.\nWhen trade resumed 15 minutes later, shares continued to fall, taking cues from the slide in European markets.\nThe S&P 500 fell 9.5% and the Nasdaq ended 9.4% lower, while losses on the UK's FTSE 100 wiped some \u00a3160.4bn off the market. In France and Germany, indexes cratered more than 12%.\nEurozone tries to ease coronavirus crisis\nTrump halts travel from Europe to US\nCoronavirus: LV pulls out of travel cover\n\"Markets are at a breaking point,\" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. \"No one knows what a total economic shutdown, however temporary, looks like.\"\nThe declines came after the US restricted travel from mainland Europe.\nLosses on European indexes accelerated after the eurozone's central bank failed to cut interest rates, although it did pledge fresh stimulus measures.\nThe New York branch of the Federal Reserve said it was pumping $1.5tr to ease strains in the debt markets, offering increased overnight loans to banks and expanding the kinds of assets it will buy to keep firms lending.\nThe announcement, which came after European markets had closed, briefly sent shares higher, but they dropped back by the end of the day.\nRate cuts by the US central bank last week and the Bank of England on Wednesday also did little to soothe investors.\n\"What we really need is some huge confidence that this isn't going to cause the kind of stress and horrible loss of life [it has] in Italy everywhere else in the world,\" said former Goldman Sachs chief economist Lord Jim O'Neill.\nStocks in Asia also saw big falls earlier, with Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closing 4.4% lower.\nPanicked selling led to trading halts in Brazil, while not a single company in the FTSE 100 index gained on Thursday.\nTravel companies saw some of the biggest falls, driven by US President Donald Trump's 30-day ban on travellers from mainland Europe.\nShares in Delta Air Lines and United Airlines - among the most affected by the ban - dropped more than 20%. In the UK, airline group IAG was down more than 15% and Tui fell 17%.\nOther companies warning on the impact of Covid-19 on Thursday included:\nBT Group announced that chief executive Philip Jansen had tested positive for coronavirus. It said he had \"relatively mild\" symptoms and would work remotely\nBroadcom said uncertainty about demand was prompting it to withdraw its 2020 growth forecast\nNorwegian said it would ground 40% of its long-haul fleet and cancel up to 25% of its short-haul flights until the end of May\nWH Smith issued a profit warning after the outbreak hit sales in its travel division, which includes store at airports and train stations\nCineworld shares fell by more than 20%. It said that in a worst-case scenario, there was a risk it might not be able to repay its debts\nEstate agent Savills said the outbreak had caused a big drop in transactions in China and across Asia\nPrincess Cruises, a line owned by Carnival, said it would suspend operations for 60 days. Viking announced a similar move\nDisney closed its California parks until the end of March\nOil prices also fell, with Brent crude down more than 8% at about $33 a barrel.\nOn the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, tensions were high. Some traders were speculating the tumbles could trigger a second trading suspension - something that has never happened, not even during the financial crisis.\nSince the start of the market turmoil, indexes in the US and elsewhere have fallen more than 20% from their recent highs - a threshold that is a red flag for a recession.\n\"It looks increasingly likely that the coming contraction will be deeper and more protracted than we were anticipating just a few days ago,\" said Jay Bryson, acting chief economist at Wells Fargo. \"The airline and hotel industries are in free fall, and there will be multiplier effects.\"\nInvestors in the US are now watching the US government response.\nImage source, AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES\nImage caption,\nUS President Donald Trump said new, temporary travel restrictions would not apply to the UK\nIn a presidential address on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he would extend deadlines for tax payments for those affected, increase low-cost loans to small businesses and provide financial relief for US workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to the illness.\nBut Republicans and Democrats in Congress appear at odds over additional steps while Mr Trump's favoured approach - a tax cut for workers - has failed to garner widespread support.\n\"The stock market at least is saying it's not been enough yet,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\nWhy should I care if stock markets fall?\nMany people's initial reaction to \"the markets\" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money.\nYet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments.\nSo big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet.\nRead more here.\nThe Western world's three largest central banks have now pitted their collective firepower against the economic chill caused by the coronavirus - to little effect.\nStock markets continue to slide. The FTSE 100 has had its worst day since Black Monday in October 1987.\nObservers again might wonder what new information is spooking investors, given that central banks have in the last 10 days done their best to halt the slide. In truth, there is little new - most traders already knew that the virus is likely to cause significant economic disruption likely to push most Western economies into recession.\nWhat may have spooked them again is President Donald Trump's decision to stop most travel between continental Europe and the United States - a big enough factor in itself, but more importantly, the manner in which it was done. There was no consultation, and Mr Trump looked uncharacteristically uncertain, as if he, too, had finally been panicked by the virus.\nThere is also a small, but telling detail - Mr Trump first said the ban would apply to cargo flights, but then corrected himself to say it would not. A big proportion of cargo, however, is carried in the belly holds of passenger aircraft. If there are no passenger flights, there will be much less cargo, an enormous disruption to exporters and manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic.\nWhat are your experiences relating to the coronavirus outbreak?

        "article": "S&P 500 share index notches up record-breaking winning streak\nPublished\n22 August 2018\nShare\nclose panel\nShare page\nCopy link\nAbout sharing\nImage source, Getty Images\nImage caption,\nThe S&P 500 is poised to mark its longest bull market\nBy Natalie Sherman\nBusiness reporter, New York\nThe S&P 500 share index, which tracks the 500 biggest public companies in America, has hit a new milestone.\nThe benchmark index on Wednesday marked 3,453 days since its prior low-point, set on 9 March 2009, when the world was reeling from the financial crisis.\nBy many counts, that is the longest run without a fall of 20% or more in index history, a \"bull\" run in market-jargon.\nOverall the index has risen almost 325% in the period, lifted by companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.\nThis year, it is up more than 6%, despite worries about rising inflation, interest rates and trade disputes.\nOn Wednesday the index was largely unchanged, closing at 2,861.82, down less than 2 points.\nThat is just shy of the record high of 2,872.87 it hit on 26 January.\nThe failure of the index to pass that threshold has left the milestone in a little doubt, since analysts typically mark the end of bull markets at their peaks. So if the market crashes before the index reaches a new high point, then analysts will declare that the bull market to have ended in January.\nHowever, most analysts expect the market to continue to rise, eventually establishing a new high.\n\"The bottom line is that the US is doing well - and much better than any other market,\" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at the S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nIrrational exuberance?\nImage caption,\nBulls represent rising markets in Wall Street terminology\nThe US has Silicon Valley to thank for much of this rally.\nApple has been the single biggest contributor to the S&P index, accounting for 4.1% of the gains since 9 March 2009, followed by Microsoft.\nOverall, technology companies contributed more than 22%, followed by the consumer discretionary sector - a category that includes Amazon - at about 16%.\nThis year, the tech sector has been responsible for more than half of the rise on the index.\nApple is first public company worth $1 trillion\nStock markets hit record highs \u2013 here are three reasons why\nAn A-Z of Business Beasts\nThis has fuelled some concerns about a tech bubble.\nBut Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said the frenzy that accompanied previous market rallies has been largely absent.\nIn April 2007, about 65% of Americans had money invested in the stock market, according to Gallup, external. That share had shrunk to about 55% this year.\n\"I don't think we're getting that kind of irrational exuberance,\" Mr Stovall said, noting the current run has been dubbed the \"most hated\" bull market.\n\"Investors were hurt so badly by the prior bear market that they have been very mistrustful.\"\nBehind the gains\nThe US government and central bank took extraordinary action in 2008 and 2009 to spark the recovery, investing billions to bail out struggling banks and car companies and buy up securities backed by troubled home loans.\nAs jobs returned, consumer spending - the main driver of the US economy - picked up. Global expansion provided another boost.\nWhile many analysts forecast the slow and steady economic rebound, the stock market gains, especially in the US, have been surprisingly strong, said John Rekenthaler, vice-president of research at Morningstar.\nHe said that's in part because US companies have largely avoided passing higher profits onto employees in the form of higher wages, helping to keep inflation in check and interest rates low.\nThey have also lifted share prices by purchasing their own shares and benefited from loose enforcement of competition rules.\nLast year, the US slashed its corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, further helping the corporate bottom line.\n\"Shareholders win and non-shareholders lose,\" Mr Rekenthaler said.\n\"What the ... analysis missed was that employees wouldn't be sharing so much in higher revenues.\"\nInvestor returns\nImage source, Reuters\nGains aside, the returns of the current bull market have been somewhat lacklustre compared to prior rallies, said Mr Silverblatt.\nSince 9 March 2009, the S&P index has risen at an annual rate of about 16.5% - compared to an average of more than 22% in prior expansions.\nThe index's roughly 325% returns fall short of the 417% gain during the previous record-setting bull market, which ran for most of the 1990s.\n\"You're not going to cry for either one, but the bottom line is the other one did better,\" Mr Silverblatt said.\nThe 2018 economy: What to watch\nUS markets are rising - so why are some people worried?\nAnalysts said the steadier returns may signal that the current bull market remains sustainable - at least over the next 12 months or so - assuming that factors like inflation and interest rates remain on their current trajectory.\n\"It's not the most lucrative but I don't know that I would say I'm dissatisfied,\" Mr Rekenthaler said, noting that inflation has also been low. \"It's got a more stable feel to it.\"\nMore on this story\nApple's market value hits $1 trillion\nPublished\n2 August 2018\nUS growth hits fastest rate since 2014\nPublished\n27 July 2018",

I fetched some wine vinegar from the larder, filled the SodaStream bottle to the brim and set to work, thinking: \u201cThis will come back to me in a good way\u201d.\nCarbonated wine vinegar burst from the tube of the SodaStream, ten times more of it coming out \u2013 it seemed - than I had put in.\nThe Axminster came off worst. It still bears the stain. I was punished with the confiscation of toys for a fortnight.

The strongest predictors of voting behaviour have been\u00a0age\n,\u00a0education level\nand\u00a0ethnicity\n-\u00a0not income.\"\nHe adds that the evidence on \"inequality and globalisation is far more nuanced than so many would have guessed\".\nMore important, he says, is the inadequate political response to the financial crisis, which has left a vacuum for populists to fill.\nArticle share tools\nFacebook\nTwitter\nShareView more share options\nShare this post\nCopy this link\nRead more about these links.Posted at 20:41 11 Nov 201620:41 11 Nov 2016\nPaypal founder joins Trump transition team\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis post contains content provided by Twitter.

In our view, these conditions have worsened.\n\"Without deep economic reform or further relief, we expect Greece's debt and other financial commitments will be unsustainable.\"\nIt added that government finances, which appeared to be improving slightly last year, had now been dented by weaker economic activity and rising arrears on taxes.\nSince the end of November 2014, Greek banks have lost about 14% of their deposit base to customer withdrawals and deposit outflows have continued.\nThe conditions have been made worse by the uncertainty over the negotiations between Athens and its main creditors - the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank.\nS&P said that economic prospects could deteriorate further unless Greece reached a deal over the next \u20ac7.2bn tranche of its bailout loan.\nBut time is running out. The ratings agency said: \"If the stalemate between Greece and its official lenders is not resolved before the middle of May, then there might not be enough time for the Greek parliament to enact whatever conditions are attached to a revised lending program.\"\nMore on this story\nGreece denies default accusations\nPublished\n14 April 2015\nEurozone: Six days for Greek deal\nPublished\n9 April 2015\nLagarde welcomes Athens payment news\nPublished\n6 April 2015\nRelated Internet Links\nS&P - Ratings - Americas\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",

But earlier this year it said that it \"deeply regrets\" that its ratings failed to anticipate the market conditions.\nMore on this story\nUS sues S&P over ratings 'fraud'\nPublished\n5 February 2013\nGeithner on 'terrible judgement' of S&P.

This is because the fees it earned incentivised it to downplay the true risk of the CDOs never being repaid, the Department said.\nThe charges went on to accuse S&P of delaying updates to its financial models that might otherwise have made clear how risky these investments were.\nFollowing the crisis, the models used by ratings agencies to assess CDOs were widely criticised for failing to consider the possibility that a downturn could afflict the entire US housing market simultaneously, simply because no such downturn had happened in recent history.\nFurthermore, the Justice Department claimed that in 2007 - in the early stages of the financial crisis, when the US housing market had taken a decisive turn for the worse - S&P knowingly continued to assign overly optimistic ratings to high-risk subprime mortgage debts.\nS&P said on Monday that it \"deeply regrets\" how its CDO ratings failed to anticipate mortgage market conditions as the financial crisis hit, and that it has since spent $400m to help bolster the quality of its ratings.\n\"Every CDO that [the department] has cited to us also independently received the same rating from another rating agency.\n\"The Department of Justice would be wrong in contending that S&P ratings were motivated by commercial considerations and not issued in good faith.\"\nMore on this story\nGeithner on 'terrible judgement' of S&P.

But financial markets do now think a Greek exit from the euro is less likely.\n\"S&P is catching up with that market optimism with this upgrade. In theory, the fact that a large part of Greek sovereign debt has already been restructured also makes future defaults a bit less likely.\"\nRelated Internet Links\nS&P\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.",
